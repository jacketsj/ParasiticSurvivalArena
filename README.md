# ParasiticSurvivalArena

Parasitic Survival Arena is a game written with XNA and C# that was originally made for a marathon.
In the game, the player controls a number of units with short lifespans, after which they disappear. Within their lifespans, they will be attacked by spewers, who can be infected with larvae to give the player control over more units, and prolong the existence of their units.
Units are controlled by clicking with the mouse cursor, in order to repel all units away from that position (with quadratic power dropoff). If a unit leaves the screen or is touched by a spewer, it will permanently disappear.
